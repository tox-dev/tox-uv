# tox-uv

This is the meta package for `tox-uv` that bundles `uv` as a dependency.

For the full documentation, see the [main repository](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-uv#tox-uv).

## Installation

```bash
pip install tox-uv  # Installs tox-uv-bare + uv
```

If you already have `uv` installed system-wide (e.g., in a Docker image), you can use the bare package instead:

```bash
pip install tox-uv-bare  # Uses system uv
```
