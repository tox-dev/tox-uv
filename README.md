**tox-uv** is a `tox` plugin, which replaces `virtualenv` and pip with `uv` in your `tox` environments. Note that you
will get both the benefits (performance) or downsides (bugs) of `uv`.

## How to use

Install `tox-uv` into the environment of your tox, and it will replace `virtualenv` and `pip` for all runs:

```bash
uv tool install tox --with tox-uv # use uv to install
tox --version # validate you are using the installed tox
tox r -e py312 # will use uv
```

## tox environment types provided

This package will provide the following new tox environments:

- `uv-venv-runner` is the ID for the tox environments [runner](https://tox.wiki/en/4.12.1/config.html#runner) for
  environments not using a lock file.
- `uv-venv-lock-runner` is the ID for the tox environments [runner](https://tox.wiki/en/4.12.1/config.html#runner) for
  environments using `uv.lock` (note we can’t detect the presence of the `uv.lock` file to enable this because that
  would break environments not using the lock file - such as your linter).
- `uv-venv-pep-517` is the ID for the PEP-517 packaging environment.
- `uv-venv-cmd-builder` is the ID for the external cmd builder.

## uv.lock support

If you want for a tox environment to use `uv sync` with a `uv.lock` file you need to change for that tox environment the
`runner` to `uv-venv-lock-runner`. Furthermore, should in such environments you use the `extras` config to instruct `uv`
to install the specified extras, for example:

```ini

[testenv:fix]
description = run code formatter and linter (auto-fix)
skip_install = true
deps =
    pre-commit-uv>=4.1.1
commands =
    pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure

[testenv:type]
runner = uv-venv-lock-runner
description = run type checker via mypy
commands =
    mypy {posargs:src}

[testenv:dev]
runner = uv-venv-lock-runner
description = dev environment
extras =
    dev
    test
    type
commands =
    uv pip tree
```

In this example:

- `fix` will use the `uv-venv-runner` and use `uv pip install` to install dependencies to the environment.
- `type` will use the `uv-venv-lock-runner` and use `uv sync` to install dependencies to the environment without any
  extra group.
- `dev` will use the `uv-venv-lock-runner` and use `uv sync` to install dependencies to the environment with the `dev`,
  `test` and `type` extra groups.

Note that when using `uv-venv-lock-runner`, _all_ dependencies will come from the lock file, controlled by `extras`.
Therefore, options like `deps` are ignored (and all others
[enumerated here](https://tox.wiki/en/stable/config.html#python-run) as Python run flags).

### `extras`

A list of string that selects, which extra groups you want to install with `uv sync`. By default, it is empty.

### `with_dev`

A boolean flag to toggle installation of the `uv` development dependencies. By default, it is false.

### External package support

Should tox be invoked with the [`--installpkg`](https://tox.wiki/en/stable/cli_interface.html#tox-run---installpkg) flag
(the argument **must** be either a wheel or source distribution) the sync operation will run with `--no-install-project`
and `uv pip install` will be used afterward to install the provided package.

## Environment creation

We use `uv venv` to create virtual environments. This process can be configured with the following options:

### `uv_seed`

This flag, set on a tox environment level, controls if the created virtual environment injects `pip`, `setuptools` and
`wheel` into the created virtual environment or not. By default, it is off. You will need to set this if you have a
project that uses the old legacy-editable mode, or your project doesn’t support the `pyproject.toml` powered isolated
build model.

### `uv_python_preference`

This flag, set on a tox environment level, controls how `uv` select the Python interpreter.

By default, `uv` will attempt to use Python versions found on the system and only download managed interpreters when
necessary. However, It is possible to adjust `uv`'s Python version selection preference with the
[python-preference](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/python-versions/#adjusting-python-version-preferences) option.

## Package installation

We use `uv pip` to install packages into the virtual environment. The behavior of this can be configured via the
following options:

### `uv_resolution`

This flag, set on a tox environment level, informs `uv` of the desired [resolution strategy]:

- `highest` - (default) selects the highest version of a package satisfying the constraints.
- `lowest` - install the **lowest** compatible versions for all dependencies, both **direct** and **transitive**.
- `lowest-direct` - opt for the **lowest** compatible versions for all **direct** dependencies, while using the
  **latest** compatible versions for all **transitive** dependencies.

This is an `uv` specific feature that may be used as an alternative to frozen constraints for test environments if the
intention is to validate the lower bounds of your dependencies during test executions.
